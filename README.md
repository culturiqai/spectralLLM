# SpectralLLM - Experimental Research Implementation

## ⚠️ RESEARCH STATUS: PRELIMINARY - NOT VALIDATED

**This is an experimental implementation with significant limitations:**

### Current Status:
- Single 214M parameter experiment
- Semantic coherence issues (0.1-0.15 score)
- Convergence plateau at 2300 PPL
- NO baseline transformer comparison
- NO standard benchmark evaluation

### What This Is:
- Research implementation of spectral processing ideas
- Proof-of-concept for frequency domain language modeling
- Educational tool for exploring spectral methods

### What This Is NOT:
- Production-ready language model
- Validated improvement over transformers
- Breakthrough technology

### Research Questions:
- Can spectral methods work for language modeling?
- What causes semantic coherence degradation?
- How do spectral LLMs compare to standard transformers?

**Community help needed for validation and improvement!**
